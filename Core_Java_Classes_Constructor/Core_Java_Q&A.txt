Q 2 . Can we have a class with no Constructor in it?
Ans: -
	It is possible for a class to have no constructor. (An important distinction to draw here is that the JVM does not require all class files to have a constructor; however, any class defined in Java does have a default constructor if a constructor is not explicitly declared 

Q 3 Can we declare class constructor as private?
Ans: -
	Yes, we can declare a constructor as private.

Q 4 Difference between constructor and function 
Ans: -
	Constructor: -
		>Constructors are similar to methods, but they are used to initialize an object.
		>Constructors do not have any return type(not even void).
		>Every time we create an object by using the new() keyword, a constructor is called.
		>If we do not create a constructor by ourself, then the default constructor(created by Java compiler) is called.

	Function: -
		>Function is a group of statements that can be called at any point in the program using its name to perform a specific task.
		>Function should have a different name than class name.
		>Function requires a valid return type

Q 5 Can we have both Default Constructor and Parameterized Constructor in the same class? 
Ans: -
	YES,we can have both Default Constructor and Parameterized Constructor in the same class.


Q7 What is the output ? 
public class StaticDemo { 
	int num1 = 6; 
	static int num2 = 10; 
		public static void main(String args[]) { 
			StaticDemo s1 = new StaticDemo(); 
			StaticDemo s2 = new StaticDemo(); 
			s1.num1 = 15; 
			s1.num2 = 17; 
			s2.num1 = 22; 
			s2.num2 = 28; 
			System.out.println(s1.num1 + " " + s1.num2 + " " + s2.num1 + " "+ s2.num2); 
	} 
} 
A. 15 17 22 28 
B. 15 17 22 17 
C. 15 28 22 28 
D. 22 17 22 28 
E. 22 28 22 28 
F. compile time error

Ans: - (C) 15 28 22 28

Q 8 What is static keyword in Java?
Ans: -
	Static is a Non-Access Modifier. Static can be applied to variable, method, nested class and initialization blocks (static block).

Q 9 What is a static variable?
Ans: -
	A Static variable gets memory allocated only once during the time of class loading. 
	All the instance of the class share the same copy of the variable, a static variable can be accessed directly by calling “<<ClassName>>.<<VariableName>>” without need to create an instance for the class. 
	value of a static variable will be common for all instances.

Q 10 What is a static method?
Ans: -
	A static method belongs to the class rather than an object. It can be called directly by using the class name “<<ClassName>>.<<MethodName>>” 
	A static method can access static variables directly and it cannot access non-static variables and can only call a static method directly and it cannot call a non-static method from it. 
	Only the main() method which is static will be called by the JVM automatically, Not all the static method will be called automatically.

Q 11 Can a static block exist without a main() method?
Ans: -
	No. You cannot have a static block alone in the class without a main method. 
This behavior was a valid one in Java 6.

Q 12 Why main() method is declared as static?
Ans: -
	If our main() method is not declared as static then the JVM has to create an object first and call, which causes the problem of having extra memory allocation.

Q 13 What is a static block?
Ans: -
	A static block is a block of code inside a Java class that will be executed when a class is first loaded into the JVM. Mostly the static block will be used for initializing the variables. 
	The static block will be called only one while loading and it cannot have any return type, or any keywords (this or super).

class test 
{ 
	static int val; 
static 
{ 
val = 100; 
} 
}

Q 14 Can we have multiple static blocks in our code?
Ans: -
	Yes, we can have more than one static block in our code. It will be executed in the same order it is written.

Q 15 Can constructors be static in Java?
Ans: -
No.
